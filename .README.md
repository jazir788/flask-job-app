# Intro 
This is a Python Flask application I am building as part of the Ultimate Python Course. 

# Setup

To run this application locally download this application as a zip file and open it in a code IDE such as VS Code or Pycharm.

Once its open within an IDE, create a config.py file within the main directory and create 2 variables : 'SECRET_KEY' which should contain a string for the secret key and
'DATABASE_URL' which will create a db file with the specified name and location.

# Note 

This project is still a WIP - Work In Progress and has not been completed as yet
