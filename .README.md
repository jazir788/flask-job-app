# Intro 
This is a Python Flask application I am building as part of the Ultimate Python Course. 

# Setup

To run this application locally download this application as a zip file and open it in a code IDE such as VS Code or Pycharm.

Once its open within an IDE, create a config.py file within the main directory and create 5 variables : 

'SECRET_KEY' which should contain a string for the secret key, set the variable to any string you want

'DATABASE_URL' which will create a db file with the specified name and location e.g. "sqlite:///data.db"

'MAIL_PORT' which should be set to 465 for gmail e.g. MAIL_PORT = 465

'MAIL_USERNAME' which should be set to your gmail account

'MAIL_PASSWORD': see below on how to get this string

'MAIL_USE_SSL' which should be set to True 

'MAIL_SERVER' which should be set to the string "smtp.gmail.com"


# Retrieving Gmail App email Password / MAIL_PASSWORD 

To retrieve this password, you will need to go into your account setting of your gmail. 

Then search for app passwords and create an application with any name e.g. flask-job-app

Copy and paste the string into MAIL_PASSWORD variable and remove the spaces e.g. AABBCCDDEE
